# Smooth-Particles

This mod adds the functionality to spawn particles when you place a block allowing a much smoother experience

 

Most blocks have their own particles such as stone blocks having pebbles and wood blocks having splinters

 

Requires Fabric API and Fabric loader



 

This mod works on the client side which means you can play all your favorite servers with it

 

 

For questions ask me on discord at watermalone1 or on GitHub by submitting an issue

 

 Thank you to GGcarrothead for helping me make this mod
